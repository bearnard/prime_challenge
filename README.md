##Profiler Challenge:

* Start by writing a simple python program (e.g. print all primes up to n)
* Write a program that takes the python file above, executes it and profiles it. We are looking for a way to analyze the codeâ€™s: time of completion, spent on each line or function, and lines executed as well as missed.
